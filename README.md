# AI-Wrong-Command-Fix
AI Wrong Command Fix is a Bash script that enhances the command-line experience by integrating AI-powered command correction. When a user mistypes a command, this script queries an AI assistant (default: Ollama) to suggest the correct command. The user can then choose to execute the suggested command automatically.
